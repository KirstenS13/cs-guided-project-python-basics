9/29/20 - Python Basics

Lectures will usually be breakout rooms apparently
    --What's the point then? Might as well just teach ourselves.

Python:

# = comment

no {}

white space matters

: are important

def defines a function

for var in var = for loop

print = console.log

list ~~ array

if ... else: = if else statement

if ... elif: = else if statement



The breakout rooms are doing absolutely nothing for me and for many others, but the instructor does not seem very empathetic about that 

It would make way more sense to teach us basic Python syntax and show us examples that we work together before shoving us into breakout rooms.

Why should I attend lecture if she expects us to do this on our own anyway?
